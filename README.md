# deeplearning-notes
This repository is based on my own study and understanding of [Deeplearning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) on Cousera by Andrew.NG.

There are 5 courses included in this specialization:

- Neural Networks and Deep Learning
- Improving Deep Neural Networks:Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization
- Structuring Machine Learning Projects
- Convolutional Neural Networks
- Sequence Models
